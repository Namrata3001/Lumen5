# Lumen5
Individual Project

Hello! Everyone, In this blog I am going to have a brief introduction to cloning of a website named "Lumen5". As this is my first individual project I ensure that I have given my level best on completing this project within the given time. 

website link -: 

My Agendas : - Breaking the whole website into the smallest divisions according to my strong zone. Technologies used - I have used HTML,CSS and Javascript for back-end .Localstorage is used for the data-storing purpose.

In the landing page where I have tried to build the same page as it is visible on the main website and also added some styles to look better, and  linked the other pages to the home page.

In login and signup page I have used HTML,CSS,Javascript and local storage to accept input from user and store it,which can be use for login purpose.

In Photo Video Maker and Facebook Video Maker page I have tried to make the page as similar as much by using HTML and CSS.

Thanks & Regards
